# cmake-good
In this repository I am following the [vector-of-bool tutorial:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yFPO1ofyF0&amp;list=PLK6MXr8gasrGmIiSuVQXpfFuE1uPT615s)
to learning CMake!

In-addition, I will be using GitHub Actions to enable me kind of CI-CD for this practice.
Hence my first workflow, only verifies the compilation step but on all platforms (windows, linux and macOS),
because, this is the power of CMake, a single build system to rule them all!!

An indication current master has pass/failed the build procces is seen here:

Note: the commits will have the specific video title for easy follow up.
Sometime I will "play" it will be noted in the commit message.
